# colorGame
Color game from Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp Series.

An array is filled with 3 (easy mode) or 6 (hard mode) randomly generated rgb colors. 
Each of the squares is assigned a color from the color array and one of colors is randomly
selected to be the color we want to identify. Clicking on the wrong color makes the square 
fade into the background and a "Try Again!" prompt comes up. Clicking the correct color changes 
all of the squares and the header background to that color while displaying a "Correct!" prompt.
Unsurprisingly, the new colors button will generate a new set of a colors when picked. This 
was a fun project : )
